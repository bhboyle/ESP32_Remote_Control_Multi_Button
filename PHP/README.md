These files are very young that this stage. I have not yet decided the method I will use for transfering data.

Currently one file is used for tranfering data and the tiggers are done with individiual files. I have chosen this method becuse I have not yet figured out how I might inlcude the MQTT topic s that have forward slashes in them so I have chosen to do that seperatly.

This might change as I had the idea of swapping the forward slash for a dollar sign as that can be sent in a URL without issue and that can be easily swopped out by in the PHP later.
